Undergrad-Code
==============

My progressive projects and work done as an undergrad computer science student. 

**For current WVU students (and everyone else):**  
Do NOT copy my code. You WILL be caught. It is very easy for professors to figure out if you have cheated.  
You are not only cheating yourself but also cheating me. Again, please do not copy my work. Thanks.
